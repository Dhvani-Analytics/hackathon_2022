# Hackathon- computer vision
Welcome to our Hackathon-2022. Through this hackathon we are trying to select interns have passion to work in computer vision and deep learning. We have internships positions for a couple of projects from Defect Recognition to Multi-Camera Multi object Tracking. You can select either C++/Python to solve these coding assignments. Best of luck everyone  

* Use issues to ask any queries 

* Only make use you use the images given in the dataset rather than using any other public images. That is if a problem has limited dataset that is a constraint and you have to develop a algorithm optimal with respect to the constraint 

1. Write an algorithm that will detect the defect in the images given below. Breakup of the mark is as given below
** Expecting a general algorithm that works for different diameter, transaltions during image acquisiton etc . 

  > Flowchart - 20 marks
  
  > Basic algorithm to find defects - 40 marks
  
  > Localizing the defect - 20
  
  > Classify the defect to flashes and cut marks - 20

### Defective Images
1. Flashes
